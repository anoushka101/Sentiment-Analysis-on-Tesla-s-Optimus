">It is unclear which factory the robots are operating in or what tasks they are completing.

There's no evidence that this robot can autonomously do anything beyond stand upright and walk short distances on a flat surface. Literally everything else we've seen it do is in tightly controlled, non-dynamic environments, usually just as a human motion-controlled animatronic.

"The faster walking in the weight loss are not important, they are ”nice to have”.
In the prior Optimus video, they demonstrated the Optimus working with a human worker as remote hands. That is much more difficult with a non-moving head.  The addition of a two degrees of freedom head (left to right and up and down) allows a remote human user to use relatively natural head movement when using the robot remotely. Because Tesla is training the robot with a type of neural network, enabling humans, more easily remote operate the robot, as a form of training, is particularly useful. 
The finger sensors are also a very big add-on as they allow the training to include important additional sensory data. While a human instinctively knows not to handle an egg like a kettle bell, a robot is not. This kinetic data training can be context sensitive.
I don’t think the Optimus robot will be ready for public distribution for quite a while. However, what they have shown should allow many uses within Tesla factories within the next year to 18 months.

Comparison with the Boston Dynamics Atlas robot are inappropriate. The Atlas robot was built as a search and rescue robot.  In that context, agility is of paramount importance. The Optimus robot will likely initially be used within Tesla factories, and then eventually for other types of manual labor where agility is a tertiary concern.",2023-12-13 19:32:42,0,comment,Section_A

"Tesla has no early market advantage on robotics or AI and no sign they will all of a suddenly catch-up. Mostly all they have is being a bit earlier to market as any advantage over the competition. EVs are too easy to make for most advantages to matter because it's easy to catch-up and not really more profitable to early to market in the long run. The only reason Tesla isn't mostly broke is because of massive stock over-valuation.

SpaceX has unique tech and some real value, but Starlink looks like mostly a flop as a consumer product with tiny amounts of subscribers and no real sign that terrestrial and cell towers wouldn't keep outpacing it in bandwidth/cost. I'm not sure Starship has much real world usefulness in a world that's more likely to be sending more and more capable robots into space than humans. Staying on the Moon or Mars is a bit torturous to think that humans will really do that to themselves in significant numbers. It makes nice movies, but .1 moon gravity is horrible for health and .37 Mars is probably also too low to sustain. The only good target for humans beside Earth is a floating Venus habitat where you can get .9G and about human body temp miles up in the super thick/hot atmosphere.

The gravity being close to 1g is much more important than people are pretending when they dream up this vision of human EXPANDING into space. Human will only tend to value their own life and comfort more vs expanding to super hostile places that are horrible for the health for anything but scientific research.

WAY too many ppl seem to think there is some space economy coming and space mining will soon happen and all that, but that's just science fiction. Humans can't really thrive in conditions so different than Earth, so we can't have Mars cities and thriving space economies because the only use is science and satellites around Earth.

Sooo that begs the question as to how many government programs will really need Starship once the whole satellite constellations idea proves to be more trouble that it's worth and certainly not scalable to many nations.",2024-05-22 09:42:41,2,comment,Section_A
">If Elon gets 25% voting power, Tesla is reincorporated in Texas, and compensation package is approved, then AI & Robotics stays within Tesla and the company can march on forward to become the largest company in the world.

Why invest in this when Hydrogen companies are 1/100th of the cost with much higher demand for their products inside railroad locomotives, marine ships and semi trucks. Sure the technology doesn't work now, but it's in the same place Tesla was in 2010. For an established Tesla investor who actually cares about the technology, there's way more money to be made in cashing out and leaving. More to the point, any Tesla investor interested in AI or robotics can just sell Tesla and invest in Microsoft or Mitsubishi.

Texas doesn't like Tesla nearly as much as California, and Texas is not mandating companies buy Tesla's semi truck as California is .. at least, not until H2 cell trucks get onto the market.

before her eyes and stood for a moment, wrinkling her nose and blinking in the sunlight. Then, 
trying to watch in all directions at once, she withdrew a few cautious steps from the tree against 
which she had been leaning.
She craned her neck to investigate the possibilities of a clump of bushes to the right and then 
withdrew farther to obtain a better angle for viewing its dark recesses. The quiet was profound 
except for the incessant buzzing of insects and the occasional chirrup of some hardy bird, braving 
the midday sun.
Gloria pouted, “I bet he went inside the house, and I’ve told him a million times that that’s not 
fair.”
With tiny lips pressed together tightly and a severe frown crinkling her forehead, she moved 
determinedly toward the two-story building up past the driveway.
Too late she heard the rustling sound behind her, followed by the distinctive and rhythmic clump-
clump of Robbie’s metal feet. She whirled about to see her triumphing companion emerge from

It doesn't work when you need your application to always do the right thing. E.g.

"I think yes, they're extremely well positioned. What I think a lots of the other comments here are missing is that lots of things are converging at the right time to make humanoid robots finally viable. 

The cost and energy density of batteries, mainly driven by electric cars is where it needs to be, compute is moving to a place where it needs to be we're seeing this with FSD in Tesla's and other self driving cars. AI is moving where it needs to be, again seen in self driving cars and also in LLMs which can be used to chain thoughts together to help the bot perform a particular task and also used to understand complex user instructions.

Also they have a pretty impressive robot as seen in the recent reveal. Walking is a bit clunky but perfectly functional but the dexterity and range of motion in the arms and hands is better than anything else I've seen. Hand movement is far more important than walking for most economic tasks. People are saying Atlas is a more impressive humanoid but it doesn't even have hands. Complex hand movement is far more economically valuable than the ability to perform summersaults. How many jobs need you to perform back flips?

I think they're also better placed than any other current robotics company to mass produce these things. They are already mass producing cars at huge volumes. I really can't imagine mass producing the Tesla bot will be any harder or any more costly than producing the Cyber truck which has been a nightmare for them to bring to market as it's such a challenging design.",2023-12-18 01:33:37,6,comment,Section_A

Are you not allowed to use any imagination or logic what so ever? Firstly, if you have one platform that can do a more diverse set of things, it will become cheaper because you can mass produce them, and they will be way cheaper for the buyers since they'll need fewer of them as compared to robot specialized for every possible use case.

Second, with a flexible enough humanoid robot that you can train with behavior cloning, you suddenly have an *interface* with the real world. The humanoid shape is perfect, if you have to choose just one, because it interfaces with anything that's built for humans. Just like you can automate any task with code on a computer, you can now automate any well-defined physical task in the real world. You don't even need AGI, just the ability to copy primitive motions and behaviors. Once you have this then people will do things that we cannot even imagine at this point, because it will be 1000x simpler and cheaper than buying a KUKA robot and hiring a team of engineers to perform a repetitive task.

You can potentially replace it with a humanoid robot. Now imagine a big production plant where there are multiple different kinds of robots, each $50k a pop or something. What if you could replace all of them with a humanoid robot which is about $80k each? It’s the versatility that they are trying to sell. If one of those different special-purpose types of robots breaks down then it’s total lockdown of the plant, but if they were all humanoids, you could just redistribute the tasks and continue with a lower yield. Also note that the manual labor is becoming scarce and more expensive by the day, everybody wants to work in white color jobs. That’s why hand made items are significantly much more expensive than machine made ones, for example hand made shoes or something.

For this kind of estimates you can use very rough numbers.  
Create a spreadsheet/code snippets, assume some reasonable numbers, check the conclusion.  
Then vary your assumptions, and check if the conclusion changes.  
Usually you will notice that the conclusion is not sensitive to the many variables, and only very few matter to change the outcome.

The weight of the device is known/estimable.  The bulk of the mass will be ""structure"",  ""copper"" (for motors), and the batteries. At 10B, the compute units also matter in the accounting.  Check the usual materials used, how much of each is produced per year, and then you will have your conclusions.

Knowing nothing about the Tesla robot I would start with:  
\- 100Kg weight

\- 30% structure

\-20% copper

\-50% batteries

\-1 Top-end CPU, 1 Top-end GPU/TPU (certainly more, but again this is rough numbers)

"That's what Boston Dynamics created ""Spot"" the robot dog for - it's actually a far more useful and adaptable form factor. 


The much-larger original (""Big Dog"") was meant to carry heavy loads in unpredictable terrain so soldiers weren't weighed down by their equipment, and to carry the wounded out.  The smaller version has been more commercially successful, and is also in use in combat zones for certain tasks.


Fwiw, the Tesla robots appear to be far behind their competitors, and much of what they've demo'd, besides walking, is via remote human operators. 


If you haven't encountered them, you might be interested in reading Isaac Asimov's ""I, Robot"" and related stories.  The movie was only loosely based on his robot stories - I believe the books are far better.  He proposed a set of rules to ethically guide robot behaviour in human society, and then goes about finding all the ways the rules are terrible or breakable.

The dumb part is why use bipeds. I'd rather be taken care of in a old folks facility packed with spider legged demon machines with Disneyland styled semi hologram faces that look like an angel with 13 faces, most of which or horrible scary creatures.




Tbf, as an embedded engineer in a niche position, let me tell you I've seen a lot of ""do it yourself"" mixed with ""what is on the Internet"", and very little ""I consulted with animators, animatronics professionals, and other professionals with expertise related to my project"".




The excuses I get for all robots being flat footed with stiff backs is that making robots is hard and that the huge amount of micro movements we use to stand and walk is astounding. It's never been the standard to use new and improved designs.",2024-02-01 11:51:31,-1,comment,Section_A

"Well, the video claims the whole robot will cost less than a standard co-bot, and has the capacity to replace every job in the 25T world economy. If that is true then it will absolutely take the world by storm. If on the other hand it lacks dexterity, takes substantial hand-coding for each new task and costs a few hundred thousand dollars it probably isn't competitive with human labor, even in high-labor-cost economies.  

I'd guess we are closer to the latter case than the former right now, but who knows? Tesla has their own factories so we will no doubt get to see them integrate their first, and we can certainly hope!

"I think yes, they're extremely well positioned. What I think a lots of the other comments here are missing is that lots of things are converging at the right time to make humanoid robots finally viable. 

The cost and energy density of batteries, mainly driven by electric cars is where it needs to be, compute is moving to a place where it needs to be we're seeing this with FSD in Tesla's and other self driving cars. AI is moving where it needs to be, again seen in self driving cars and also in LLMs which can be used to chain thoughts together to help the bot perform a particular task and also used to understand complex user instructions.

Also they have a pretty impressive robot as seen in the recent reveal. Walking is a bit clunky but perfectly functional but the dexterity and range of motion in the arms and hands is better than anything else I've seen. Hand movement is far more important than walking for most economic tasks. People are saying Atlas is a more impressive humanoid but it doesn't even have hands. Complex hand movement is far more economically valuable than the ability to perform summersaults. How many jobs need you to perform back flips?

I think they're also better placed than any other current robotics company to mass produce these things. They are already mass producing cars at huge volumes. I really can't imagine mass producing the Tesla bot will be any harder or any more costly than producing the Cyber truck which has been a nightmare for them to bring to market as it's such a challenging design.",2023-12-18 01:33:37,6,comment,Section_A

"I'd say boston dynamics robot 10 years ago is still more impressive than anything else out thee, humanoid robots are moving slow and Tesla is no exception. I've seen nothing impressive from it, it's just another humanoid robot desig, seemingly too janky to ever be real. Even Boston Dynamic robot is too bulky and limited to be useful for the cost. You have to keep in mind, like a robot vacuum you'll have to do lots of maintenance to keep those things running. It's not reliable like organics, the gears and servos and imperfect locomotion tear themselves up constantly and don't heal.

The me, nothing than janky and cumbersome is going to survive real world use. I'm not sure we can even make gears and hydraulics that complex for cheap enough and we may need something more like electronic muscles vs pumps and hoses or gears/pullies. 

We have nothing that works like a muscle, we just have compressors and hydraulics, which is slow, heavy and inefficiency when compared to muscles and tendons. It's totally different when you're just spinning wheels at 90%+ efficiency vs all that humanoid locomotion and arm and hand movement.

They have the infrastructure and path to collect all the training data they want by putting their bots to work in Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company + suppliers and partners.

Tesla is a rapidly growing manufacturer that doesn’t have union contracts to potentially interfere with using bots however they are useful. Tesla could probably put tens of thousands of Optimus bots on the job internally and ramp up its manufacturing of them well before any outside leases are sold.

">IS NOT ANY PROVEN USE CASES

Are you not allowed to use any imagination or logic what so ever? Firstly, if you have one platform that can do a more diverse set of things, it will become cheaper because you can mass produce them, and they will be way cheaper for the buyers since they'll need fewer of them as compared to robot specialized for every possible use case.

Second, with a flexible enough humanoid robot that you can train with behavior cloning, you suddenly have an *interface* with the real world. The humanoid shape is perfect, if you have to choose just one, because it interfaces with anything that's built for humans. Just like you can automate any task with code on a computer, you can now automate any well-defined physical task in the real world. You don't even need AGI, just the ability to copy primitive motions and behaviors. Once you have this then people will do things that we cannot even imagine at this point, because it will be 1000x simpler and cheaper than buying a KUKA robot and hiring a team of engineers to perform a repetitive task.

The jobs were straightforward, ‘cut or weld these things that are marked in this way’, but accessing them required maneuvering spaces meant for humans. It always struck me as a good place for robot workers eventually, having a round-the-clock worker with machine speed and precision, without having to worry about exposure to the many hazards of that kind of environment.",2023-12-17 23:14:12,3,comment,Section_A

"I don’t think it’s about finding use cases. It’s about if they can make it cheap enough for any use cases! You see any robot other than a humanoid robot? You can potentially replace it with a humanoid robot. Now imagine a big production plant where there are multiple different kinds of robots, each $50k a pop or something. What if you could replace all of them with a humanoid robot which is about $80k each? It’s the versatility that they are trying to sell. If one of those different special-purpose types of robots breaks down then it’s total lockdown of the plant, but if they were all humanoids, you could just redistribute the tasks and continue with a lower yield. Also note that the manual labor is becoming scarce and more expensive by the day, everybody wants to work in white color jobs. That’s why hand made items are significantly much more expensive than machine made ones, for example hand made shoes or something.

"[Atlas was doing parkour 6 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LikxFZZO2sk). There are also [a number of companies in this space that have already reached this milestone](https://rossdawson.com/futurist/companies-creating-future/top-companies-rise-humanoid-robots/), with [Unitree being on the verge of selling theirs at consumer prices](https://www.unitree.com/g1/).

I'm not saying they're all trying to ""solve"" the same ""problem,"" but from the outside, Tesla has yet to do anything impressive (relatively speaking) in this space. They're definitely good at marketing (at least towards those who are susceptible to it), but until these things are owned by real customers doing real things in real environments, this doesn't amount to much.

It doesn't help that Musk really rubs people the wrong way, but you can't discount *his* reputation when we're talking about *his* company. People are right to point to his failure to deliver proper FSD in the timelines he's suggested as evidence that this could very well meet the same fate. It'd be foolish to ignore that.

And as far as your progression goes: give me hundreds of billions of dollars and a company like Tesla and watch what I can do in 3 years. Again, it's not particularly impressive that a company that has existed in this space for decades is able to put together a prototype like this in this timeframe. It *would* be impressive if we were talking about a start-up that came from nowhere or a technology that has never been seen before, but Tesla has too many resources to be giving them accolades for almost catching up to the competition.

I'm not even trying to hate on Tesla or these bots. I'm just pointing out that in a sub like r/robotics, you can expect users to be aware of all of this context and to judge these kinds of posts accordingly. I think if you can get past people's distaste for Tesla, we'd all be rooting for them (just as we would be for any of these companies) since the more people working on it the better.

"\> Are there any benchmarks or similar projects that could help us approximate the material usage per robot?  
For this kind of estimates you can use very rough numbers.  
Create a spreadsheet/code snippets, assume some reasonable numbers, check the conclusion.  
Then vary your assumptions, and check if the conclusion changes.  
Usually you will notice that the conclusion is not sensitive to the many variables, and only very few matter to change the outcome.

The weight of the device is known/estimable.  The bulk of the mass will be ""structure"",  ""copper"" (for motors), and the batteries. At 10B, the compute units also matter in the accounting.  Check the usual materials used, how much of each is produced per year, and then you will have your conclusions.

Knowing nothing about the Tesla robot I would start with:  
\- 100Kg weight

\- 30% structure

\-20% copper

\-50% batteries

\-1 Top-end CPU, 1 Top-end GPU/TPU (certainly more, but again this is rough numbers)

"I don't get where this narrative has come from. Actually I do, its Tesla showing a sped up marketing clip 5 years ago with pre-programmed route (which pretty much every other company does) and people like you still bitching about it.

Millions of Tesla's are produced every year, 10ks of thousand of people already using TESLA FSD software and posting their drives on youtube for people to watch.

Is it currently flawless, no, is it already highly capable today, yes.

The key point almost everyone doesn't get, which is actually the main point, is that all cars Tesla has been producing in years past (like 5 million total fleet) plus currently (2 million cars per year and rising) have the hardware necessary for self driving.

As soon as the software is advanced enough (might take 2 years, 4 years, 8 years or whatever time) it will be an over the air software update to the car and then bam! Overnight Tesla has a fleet of 20 million self driving cars.

The self driving cars are being mass produced right now. Most of you just don't get it because the software is still a toddler or young teenager. It would be like 100% ignoring the existence of your aging child just because at 10 years old they cant yet drive without incident. Yet somehow, you wouldn't doubt that once a little older they would eventually be able to drive.

"I think yes, they're extremely well positioned. What I think a lots of the other comments here are missing is that lots of things are converging at the right time to make humanoid robots finally viable. 

The cost and energy density of batteries, mainly driven by electric cars is where it needs to be, compute is moving to a place where it needs to be we're seeing this with FSD in Tesla's and other self driving cars. AI is moving where it needs to be, again seen in self driving cars and also in LLMs which can be used to chain thoughts together to help the bot perform a particular task and also used to understand complex user instructions.

Also they have a pretty impressive robot as seen in the recent reveal. Walking is a bit clunky but perfectly functional but the dexterity and range of motion in the arms and hands is better than anything else I've seen. Hand movement is far more important than walking for most economic tasks. People are saying Atlas is a more impressive humanoid but it doesn't even have hands. Complex hand movement is far more economically valuable than the ability to perform summersaults. How many jobs need you to perform back flips?

I think they're also better placed than any other current robotics company to mass produce these things. They are already mass producing cars at huge volumes. I really can't imagine mass producing the Tesla bot will be any harder or any more costly than producing the Cyber truck which has been a nightmare for them to bring to market as it's such a challenging design.",2023-12-18 01:33:37,6,comment,Section_A

">IS NOT ANY PROVEN USE CASES

Are you not allowed to use any imagination or logic what so ever? Firstly, if you have one platform that can do a more diverse set of things, it will become cheaper because you can mass produce them, and they will be way cheaper for the buyers since they'll need fewer of them as compared to robot specialized for every possible use case.

Second, with a flexible enough humanoid robot that you can train with behavior cloning, you suddenly have an *interface* with the real world. The humanoid shape is perfect, if you have to choose just one, because it interfaces with anything that's built for humans. Just like you can automate any task with code on a computer, you can now automate any well-defined physical task in the real world. You don't even need AGI, just the ability to copy primitive motions and behaviors. Once you have this then people will do things that we cannot even imagine at this point, because it will be 1000x simpler and cheaper than buying a KUKA robot and hiring a team of engineers to perform a repetitive task.

"What would constitute a proven use case prior to them actually be made and in use? I would think anywhere that people are doing dexterous work in spaces meant to be traversed by humans would be a use case. For example, the shipyard I used to work at would have dozens of people on rotation at any given time for welding/cutting jobs where there was often not any work for most of them most shifts, but they had to keep them all on payroll so enough people would always be available if/when needed. The jobs were straightforward, ‘cut or weld these things that are marked in this way’, but accessing them required maneuvering spaces meant for humans. It always struck me as a good place for robot workers eventually, having a round-the-clock worker with machine speed and precision, without having to worry about exposure to the many hazards of that kind of environment.",2023-12-17 23:14:12,3,comment,Section_A

"I don’t think it’s about finding use cases. It’s about if they can make it cheap enough for any use cases! You see any robot other than a humanoid robot? You can potentially replace it with a humanoid robot. Now imagine a big production plant where there are multiple different kinds of robots, each $50k a pop or something. What if you could replace all of them with a humanoid robot which is about $80k each? It’s the versatility that they are trying to sell. If one of those different special-purpose types of robots breaks down then it’s total lockdown of the plant, but if they were all humanoids, you could just redistribute the tasks and continue with a lower yield. Also note that the manual labor is becoming scarce and more expensive by the day, everybody wants to work in white color jobs. That’s why hand made items are significantly much more expensive than machine made ones, for example hand made shoes or something. Granted we are very far from having a general purpose humanoid robots, hence all this is just talk!

"\> Are there any benchmarks or similar projects that could help us approximate the material usage per robot?  
For this kind of estimates you can use very rough numbers.  
Create a spreadsheet/code snippets, assume some reasonable numbers, check the conclusion.  
Then vary your assumptions, and check if the conclusion changes.  
Usually you will notice that the conclusion is not sensitive to the many variables, and only very few matter to change the outcome.

The weight of the device is known/estimable.  The bulk of the mass will be ""structure"",  ""copper"" (for motors), and the batteries. At 10B, the compute units also matter in the accounting.  Check the usual materials used, how much of each is produced per year, and then you will have your conclusions.

Knowing nothing about the Tesla robot I would start with:  
\- 100Kg weight

\- 30% structure

\-20% copper

\-50% batteries

\-1 Top-end CPU, 1 Top-end GPU/TPU (certainly more, but again this is rough numbers)

"That's what Boston Dynamics created ""Spot"" the robot dog for - it's actually a far more useful and adaptable form factor. 


The much-larger original (""Big Dog"") was meant to carry heavy loads in unpredictable terrain so soldiers weren't weighed down by their equipment, and to carry the wounded out.  The smaller version has been more commercially successful, and is also in use in combat zones for certain tasks.


Fwiw, the Tesla robots appear to be far behind their competitors, and much of what they've demo'd, besides walking, is via remote human operators. 


If you haven't encountered them, you might be interested in reading Isaac Asimov's ""I, Robot"" and related stories.  The movie was only loosely based on his robot stories - I believe the books are far better.  He proposed a set of rules to ethically guide robot behaviour in human society, and then goes about finding all the ways the rules are terrible or breakable.

"Are Tesla's Humanoid Robots the Future of Construction? Hey everyone! As someone working in the construction industry, I can’t help but notice Elon Musk making headlines again with Tesla's humanoid robots. The latest buzz is about how these robots could revolutionize marble factories and construction jobs. I came across this interesting article that dives into it: [How Tesla’s Humanoid Robots Are Revolutionizing Factories and Construction](https://www.mikolmarmi.com/blogs/marble-granite-library/how-tesla-s-humanoid-robots-are-revolutionizing-factories-and-construction-are-humans-being-replaced).

It's got me thinking—do you really think we’ll see these robots replacing human workers on job sites in the near future? I mean, they could handle the dangerous and repetitive tasks that come with the job, but what does that mean for us? Are we looking at a future where robots and humans work side by side, or is this a step towards more job losses in the industry?

I'd love to hear your thoughts and any experiences you've had with automation in construction. Let’s discuss!",2024-10-18 02:52:17,0,post,Section_B

Wow, AI tech that learns from its surroundings and adapts to new tasks?  How Advanced! /s

If tesla bots AI was so advanced, he would have it deployed to robotic arms that work his factories.

Why would a marble factory deploy a Tesla bot?  The task is repetitive, what advantages so a humanoid robot give over a fixed robot arm?

The key thing that makes SciFi robots useful in movies isn't the fact they look and operate as a humanoid, it's usually because their dexterity is actually *better* than a human",2024-10-18 05:26:52,3,comment,Section_B

"1. Tesla's robots are not unique in any way. There are at least a dozen companies investing heavily into humanoid robotics, and countless other smaller companies and grad student teams and other people working on specific pieces (well articulated hand, ""skin"" that can sense, computer vision, etc). Including one companies name in this question is odd and nonsensical. The post you linked is very light on specific details and I'm fairly certain is just straight up lying. What is the name of the marble company? How many robots did they buy? Why is there no coverage of this anywhere else? Why is there no video footage of tesla bots doing any of those things the post says they can do?
2. Yes, humanoid robots will likely replace humans in nearly every job they currently do.... eventually. Whether that time span is going to be 2 years or 200 remains to be seen. To my knowledge, there are not any humanoid robots employed en masse yet. Various companies have a couple bots ""working"" but they are mostly just talking and giving directions or providing information. They are essentially a gimmick at this point. They are not performing manual labor. Yet.

The direction things are heading seems to suggest that physical, manual labor type jobs in the real, physical world are harder to automate then thought/decision/creativity-based jobs. It seems likely the segments of the workforce that are most likely to experience significant reductions first are things like computer programmers, graphic artists, music composers, copywriters.

This role is crucial for developing a 5G network that ensures a superior connectivity experience for Tesla’s range of vehicles, as well as the Optimus robot within Tesla’s premises.

Lead Staff Engineer Pat Ruelke shared the job posting on LinkedIn (via @Tesla_App_iOS), calling for an “ace engineer” to spearhead this initiative and push the boundaries of what’s possible with 5G, aiming for a future where Tesla products communicate seamlessly over private 5G networks.

Tesla’s job listing emphasizes the necessity for a dynamic individual capable of independent and creative problem-solving to deliver seamless integration and reliable connectivity through its private 5G infrastructure. This approach not only promises to enhance the functionality of Tesla’s products but also positions the company at the forefront of leveraging 5G technology’s potential benefits, such as significantly reduced latency and increased data transmission rates.

"I dunno.

They're behind in some aspects, but I think the other humanoid robots are going to have the same problems as Legacy Auto.

You'll have a company build the robot, but it'll be limited by all the software that gets thrown into to control various components.

Tesla, being vertically integrated, is able to take their AI inference compute, and FSD training and such, and throw it at a bot and result in a more uniform experience. 

I'm kind of waiting to see how the Grok integration works in the car before making up my mind on things, because the car is basically a robot that can only drive.

So, once they sort that out, all they need to do is teach the bot how to learn to perform tasks

Which, Elon's thing about showing the robot a YouTube video shouldn't be that far off the mark, Ashok has already stated they can use YouTube videos to teach the car how to drive.

I think the limiting factor is that the video will need to be recorded in a ""first person"" poojt of view, with a camera strapped to forehead or something.

In theory, with Grok integration, if there's a narration with the motions, then it can infer what to do based on that.

Like a FPV of someone folding laundry, but a narration to go along eith it that says ""To fold my shirt, I first goes it out in front of me, with the shirt's tag facing me, then tuck the neck line under my chin, fold arms in behind the first, then grab the base of the shirt and fold it up to the neck line, and put the shirt in a stack"", while doing those actions.

Kind of like eLearnings yoy have to sit through when you get hired for a job.

So, in theory, I would expect a collection of YouTube channels that has videos that help train Optimus to do stuff.

You could, in theory, just subscribe the bot to a channel and have it always looking for new tasks to learn, but you have to approve them.

The approvals ensure that someone doesn't upload a ""How to kill your master"" tutorial for the bot.

From what I understand, the basic mechanics are there, it's just putting it altogether.

Competitors right now don't have a means of easily training the humanoid robots in the fashion described above.  Not that I'm aware of.

I mean, Tesla doesn't either, but again, the pieces are there...  I don't think the competitors even have the pieces under the same roof like Tesla.  Tesla does.  Well, they're all under Elon, which is basically the same thing",2024-06-15 16:12:44,-3,comment,Section_A

"I think  everyone is missing the point with the latest Optimus robot demonstrations I have seen a lot of articles and posts from “The Verge” and “Futurism” and others pointing out the robots were obviously remote controlled by humans.

Firstly, when have we ever seen a completely untethered battery powered robot that allows you to remotely control human body movements to that level of accuracy? That alone was science fiction until now.

Secondly, what this level of fine control enables is training data AND supervised learning. We all know that the plan is to use AI, not hard coding to teach Optimus how to do useful tasks. The problem is how to record human movement pattern into data that a robot understands. What easier way than controlling the robot directly, and taking the reins to correct if it makes the wrong movement. Remove control provides all this information in the same way as the LLMs feed on text.

And so the infeasible suddenly looks very feasible indeed. Optimus really will be able to perform most tasks that a human can. You don’t need to be an AI expert to understand it.

There is this weird focus on what Optimus can’t do yet, or what Boston Dynamics can do better, and yes, I think this demonstration was poorly communicated. However I don’t think people are understanding the magnitude of what Tesla has already achieved at this stage.",2024-10-22 11:47:27,0,post,Section_B

He did that because he knew the robots looked more impressive than they really were from a technology perspective, so it was better to say nothing.

The fact that they were not open about what they were showing breaks trust. And this is what folks are calling out. Tech journalists can’t look at the source code and review every detail.

"Hasn't it always been obvious what Tesla was demonstrating? If you pay any kind of attention, you should be able to notice when a demonstration is about the hardware and when it's about the software.

Hint: When they show the camera feed of the robot with the ""what the AI sees"" overlay, the demo is about the software. When not, the demo is about the hardware and is either using remote control or preprogrammed motions.

---

My take from the Cybertruck event:

* The dynamic balancing is superb. Those robots are standing very stable using human-like micro movements to balance instead of being stiff like a box or swaying like a tree.
* The range of motion, grip-strength, and speed of the hands is at a level that seems capable of covering most of what human hands can do. All hands we've seen before that reached or surpassed this level had big boxes with many motors attached to them, but Tesla manages it with human-sized arms. Impressive.
* Body movement speed and range of motion is impressive for a robot that fits within a human-shaped envelope. Just look at those dancers (that very obviously are running preprogrammed motions, duh). We are reaching uncanny valley territory here already---I wouldn't be surprised if they had to drop those ""face shields"" at some point and go with a ""visible parts"" face to not freak out people.",2024-10-25 11:28:58,1,comment,Section_B

"Teleoperation of the bots is a temporary step.  The level of progress in training the neural nets is quite remarkable.  While many are sceptical of the abilities of the current versions, let's keep in mind the rate of change, and also that these bots are being designed to be cheap (relatively speaking) to manufacture.  While I don't expect to see the bots operating in a domestic setting within the next five years, I do expect to see them being used increasingly in manufacturing, and potentially in areas like mining and resource extraction, using equipment and processes that were built for humans.  If the bots already have the ""intelligence"" to be able to initiate action, and then correct that action if the result was suboptimal, then we have the possibility of an exponential increase in the computing and perception capabilities, all of which is shareable with other bots.

Personally, I'm much more concerned that these bots will be economically-useful much earlier than we can conceive, displacing human labour in a way that our government and society cannot effectively handle.",2024-10-22 14:10:01,1,comment,Section_B

One thing that stood out to me was that tesla attributed the improved walking performance of the Optimus Gen 2 to its new articulated toes (circled on right image). That is certainly true; in my experiments with building an [adult-sized humanoid robot](https://github.com/ChinJY/Project-OpaNoid) (left image) 4 years ago I found that toe mobility has a large impact on walking gait.",2023-12-13 08:21:05,26,comment,Section_A

"This is insane progress on by the Optimus team! As someone whose research is slightly related to this area, I know a lot of PhD students who were hired to work on Optimus team to do RL/imitation learning for Optimus controls and planning.

The harder part has always been hardware. Seems like Tesla has wonderful progress on that end thanks to their in-house expertise and bunch of folks they hired. Once they master the hardware (high DoF fingers, high-torque motors, enough battery to last a few hours, tactile sensors and F/T sensors), they'd spend time (or parallely working on it rn!) on high-fidelity simulators and collecting human-demonstrations data to train it to do tasks end-to-end. Remember that this is completely different from the approach Boston Dynamics took over the last many years - their work has always been on the traditional controls side without much learning. Learning has certain downsides, but with enough compute and data they can be eliminated! Boston Dynamics realized the importance of learning too - they started Boston Dynamics AI institute, although AFAIK it is independent from Boston Dynamics as an org and I am not sure how much of it is actually going into the product. 

Don't forget that there are multiple billion-dollar valuation companies working in this space, and Tesla is making insane progress when compared to all of them! This is a whole new market segment for Tesla! It's funny cause Brett Adcock tries to be Elon-like by starting Figure ([https://twitter.com/Figure\_robot](https://twitter.com/Figure_robot)) but Tesla seems to beat them on all ends by a huge-margin.

TL;DR: Given good, capable hardware, I wouldn't worry about specific details in their motion/behavior - that area can make insane progress in relatively short time thanks to simulators and end-to-end learning.",2023-12-13 02:33:22,67,comment,Section_A

This role is crucial for developing a 5G network that ensures a superior connectivity experience for Tesla’s range of vehicles, as well as the Optimus robot within Tesla’s premises.

Lead Staff Engineer Pat Ruelke shared the job posting on LinkedIn (via @Tesla_App_iOS), calling for an “ace engineer” to spearhead this initiative and push the boundaries of what’s possible with 5G, aiming for a future where Tesla products communicate seamlessly over private 5G networks.

Tesla’s job listing emphasizes the necessity for a dynamic individual capable of independent and creative problem-solving to deliver seamless integration and reliable connectivity through its private 5G infrastructure. This approach not only promises to enhance the functionality of Tesla’s products but also positions the company at the forefront of leveraging 5G technology’s potential benefits, such as significantly reduced latency and increased data transmission rates.

5G technolgoy represents a considerable upgrade from 4G, most importantly reduced latency, which can in turn result in faster download speeds. It does however come with higher costs and a reduced coverage area.",2024-03-27 00:10:04,19,comment,Section_A

"I dunno.

They're behind in some aspects, but I think the other humanoid robots are going to have the same problems as Legacy Auto.

You'll have a company build the robot, but it'll be limited by all the software that gets thrown into to control various components.

Tesla, being vertically integrated, is able to take their AI inference compute, and FSD training and such, and throw it at a bot and result in a more uniform experience. 

I'm kind of waiting to see how the Grok integration works in the car before making up my mind on things, because the car is basically a robot that can only drive.

So, once they sort that out, all they need to do is teach the bot how to learn to perform tasks

Which, Elon's thing about showing the robot a YouTube video shouldn't be that far off the mark, Ashok has already stated they can use YouTube videos to teach the car how to drive.

I think the limiting factor is that the video will need to be recorded in a ""first person"" poojt of view, with a camera strapped to forehead or something.

In theory, with Grok integration, if there's a narration with the motions, then it can infer what to do based on that.

Like a FPV of someone folding laundry, but a narration to go along eith it that says ""To fold my shirt, I first goes it out in front of me, with the shirt's tag facing me, then tuck the neck line under my chin, fold arms in behind the first, then grab the base of the shirt and fold it up to the neck line, and put the shirt in a stack"", while doing those actions.

Kind of like eLearnings yoy have to sit through when you get hired for a job.

So, in theory, I would expect a collection of YouTube channels that has videos that help train Optimus to do stuff.

You could, in theory, just subscribe the bot to a channel and have it always looking for new tasks to learn, but you have to approve them.

The approvals ensure that someone doesn't upload a ""How to kill your master"" tutorial for the bot.

From what I understand, the basic mechanics are there, it's just putting it altogether.

Competitors right now don't have a means of easily training the humanoid robots in the fashion described above.  Not that I'm aware of.

I mean, Tesla doesn't either, but again, the pieces are there...  I don't think the competitors even have the pieces under the same roof like Tesla.  Tesla does.  Well, they're all under Elon, which is basically the same thing",2024-06-15 16:12:44,-3,comment,Section_A

"I think  everyone is missing the point with the latest Optimus robot demonstrations I have seen a lot of articles and posts from “The Verge” and “Futurism” and others pointing out the robots were obviously remote controlled by humans.

Firstly, when have we ever seen a completely untethered battery powered robot that allows you to remotely control human body movements to that level of accuracy? That alone was science fiction until now.

Secondly, what this level of fine control enables is training data AND supervised learning. We all know that the plan is to use AI, not hard coding to teach Optimus how to do useful tasks. The problem is how to record human movement pattern into data that a robot understands. What easier way than controlling the robot directly, and taking the reins to correct if it makes the wrong movement. Remove control provides all this information in the same way as the LLMs feed on text.

And so the infeasible suddenly looks very feasible indeed. Optimus really will be able to perform most tasks that a human can. You don’t need to be an AI expert to understand it.

There is this weird focus on what Optimus can’t do yet, or what Boston Dynamics can do better, and yes, I think this demonstration was poorly communicated.

He did that because he knew the robots looked more impressive than they really were from a technology perspective, so it was better to say nothing.

---

My take from the Cybertruck event:

* The dynamic balancing is superb. Those robots are standing very stable using human-like micro movements to balance instead of being stiff like a box or swaying like a tree.
* The range of motion, grip-strength, and speed of the hands is at a level that seems capable of covering most of what human hands can do. All hands we've seen before that reached or surpassed this level had big boxes with many motors attached to them, but Tesla manages it with human-sized arms. Impressive.
* Body movement speed and range of motion is impressive for a robot that fits within a human-shaped envelope. Just look at those dancers (that very obviously are running preprogrammed motions, duh). We are reaching uncanny valley territory here already---I wouldn't be surprised if they had to drop those ""face shields"" at some point and go with a ""visible parts"" face to not freak out people.",2024-10-25 11:28:58,1,comment,Section_B

"Teleoperation of the bots is a temporary step.  The level of progress in training the neural nets is quite remarkable.  While many are sceptical of the abilities of the current versions, let's keep in mind the rate of change, and also that these bots are being designed to be cheap (relatively speaking) to manufacture.  While I don't expect to see the bots operating in a domestic setting within the next five years, I do expect to see them being used increasingly in manufacturing, and potentially in areas like mining and resource extraction, using equipment and processes that were built for humans.  If the bots already have the ""intelligence"" to be able to initiate action, and then correct that action if the result was suboptimal, then we have the possibility of an exponential increase in the computing and perception capabilities, all of which is shareable with other bots.

Personally, I'm much more concerned that these bots will be economically-useful much earlier than we can conceive, displacing human labour in a way that our government and society cannot effectively handle.",2024-10-22 14:10:01,1,comment,Section_B

This role is crucial for developing a 5G network that ensures a superior connectivity experience for Tesla’s range of vehicles, as well as the Optimus robot within Tesla’s premises.

Lead Staff Engineer Pat Ruelke shared the job posting on LinkedIn (via @Tesla_App_iOS), calling for an “ace engineer” to spearhead this initiative and push the boundaries of what’s possible with 5G, aiming for a future where Tesla products communicate seamlessly over private 5G networks.

Tesla’s job listing emphasizes the necessity for a dynamic individual capable of independent and creative problem-solving to deliver seamless integration and reliable connectivity through its private 5G infrastructure. This approach not only promises to enhance the functionality of Tesla’s products but also positions the company at the forefront of leveraging 5G technology’s potential benefits, such as significantly reduced latency and increased data transmission rates.

5G technolgoy represents a considerable upgrade from 4G, most importantly reduced latency, which can in turn result in faster download speeds. It does however come with higher costs and a reduced coverage area.",2024-03-27 00:10:04,19,comment,Section_A

"I think  everyone is missing the point with the latest Optimus robot demonstrations I have seen a lot of articles and posts from “The Verge” and “Futurism” and others pointing out the robots were obviously remote controlled by humans.

Firstly, when have we ever seen a completely untethered battery powered robot that allows you to remotely control human body movements to that level of accuracy? That alone was science fiction until now.

Secondly, what this level of fine control enables is training data AND supervised learning. We all know that the plan is to use AI, not hard coding to teach Optimus how to do useful tasks. The problem is how to record human movement pattern into data that a robot understands. What easier way than controlling the robot directly, and taking the reins to correct if it makes the wrong movement. Remove control provides all this information in the same way as the LLMs feed on text.

And so the infeasible suddenly looks very feasible indeed. Optimus really will be able to perform most tasks that a human can. You don’t need to be an AI expert to understand it.

There is this weird focus on what Optimus can’t do yet, or what Boston Dynamics can do better, and yes, I think this demonstration was poorly communicated.

---

My take from the Cybertruck event:

* The dynamic balancing is superb. Those robots are standing very stable using human-like micro movements to balance instead of being stiff like a box or swaying like a tree.
* The range of motion, grip-strength, and speed of the hands is at a level that seems capable of covering most of what human hands can do. All hands we've seen before that reached or surpassed this level had big boxes with many motors attached to them, but Tesla manages it with human-sized arms. Impressive.
* Body movement speed and range of motion is impressive for a robot that fits within a human-shaped envelope. Just look at those dancers (that very obviously are running preprogrammed motions, duh). We are reaching uncanny valley territory here already---I wouldn't be surprised if they had to drop those ""face shields"" at some point and go with a ""visible parts"" face to not freak out people.",2024-10-25 11:28:58,1,comment,Section_B

"It's just the topical hate on anything Tesla. What would anyone else's response be to the question of who else is building robots like these? I would say Boston Dynamics had a good start. But for the Tesla bots, these are designed differently and speed to market is coming along just fine.",2024-10-22 12:46:54,-1,comment,Section_B

"Teleoperation of the bots is a temporary step.  The level of progress in training the neural nets is quite remarkable.  While many are sceptical of the abilities of the current versions, let's keep in mind the rate of change, and also that these bots are being designed to be cheap (relatively speaking) to manufacture.  While I don't expect to see the bots operating in a domestic setting within the next five years, I do expect to see them being used increasingly in manufacturing, and potentially in areas like mining and resource extraction, using equipment and processes that were built for humans.  If the bots already have the ""intelligence"" to be able to initiate action, and then correct that action if the result was suboptimal, then we have the possibility of an exponential increase in the computing and perception capabilities, all of which is shareable with other bots.

Personally, I'm much more concerned that these bots will be economically-useful much earlier than we can conceive, displacing human labour in a way that our government and society cannot effectively handle.",2024-10-22 14:10:01,1,comment,Section_B
"Let’s me honest no one cares about the people that feel lied to.  

The end goal of this “Dog & Ponny show” was to create an Experience, stir investors interest.  Later the investors are told how that was done during their Investment exploration talks.  But that Moment, that moment still sticks with them.

And if their was a few billionaires in that crowd that had a robot do a service for them… oh I bet their wallets we’re getting hard at the possible ROI.  

Damn all those Fast food place just itching to fire their humans to replace with Fry flipping bots. 

I’m all for the bots, so so many dangerous jobs they can help do.  Just sucks they might be cheap enough all the penny pitching companies will want them too, for subs and frys >.<",2024-10-22 12:57:16,0,comment,Section_B
What would be really interesting to know is what kind of UI does the operator have — joysticks? A button “pour beer” which then kicks the onboard program recognizing necessary objects?,2024-10-22 12:43:00,0,comment,Section_B
"I was impressed by it. Teleoperation was previously denied to be a feature, glad they went back on it. Would love if people could share videos of all the more impressive demonstrations they have seen. While Boston dynamics park our videos are neat, I don't personally need a park our robot, this presentation was much more relevant to what I want from a robot.",2024-10-22 16:21:12,0,comment,Section_B
"Yo, tech's movin' fast! Remote-control robots are already helpin' robots learn by recordin' human moves. Soon, bots like Optimus might do what we do, no sweat. It's not bout' what they can't do now but how far they've come.💥",2024-10-22 16:28:14,0,comment,Section_B
"I'll bet all the robot's actions during the event were being recorded and will become part of the data set that the robots will be trained with. LIke with the cars, they need a gigantic amount of data, recording all the movements, images and sounds that the robot encounters, to train the AI. There are likely to be more events with puppeted robots in order to create more useful training data.",2024-10-22 16:04:15,-1,comment,Section_B
"Telesurgery is still quite far away. Both teams had failsafes involved and full hospital staffs.  

Robot surgery allows trained doctors to change from the inches scale to the millimeter scale. This is so far different from Tesla is doing. I’m shocked it’s being used as an example.  

Can robots operate remotely. Yes. Can robots do multiple different tasks across multiple human environments. No. This was a great presentation.  ",2024-10-22 17:30:39,0,comment,Section_B
"I’m aware we have robots with tele-operations, I specifically pointed out this is an untethered humanoid robot, which is significantly harder to do. I hope they will get to the point of having full control of all four limbs - maybe they can to some degree but didn’t want to risk any robots falling over.",2024-10-22 13:21:46,-1,comment,Section_B
"With your comment, you show you truly misunderstand Hyundai Dynamics (Hyundai owns 80%). They are purely research and they currently only focus on dexterity and perception. They brag about their legs, but they haven't yet done hands. They use LIDAR, but they haven't explored true visual perception. They talk about cooperating with humans but haven't even touched language and communication yet.",2024-10-22 13:22:47,-3,comment,Section_B
"The Amazon stores thing was flat-out misrepresented. The Indians overseas weren't literally tagging EVERY SINGLE ITEM. They were just tagging or reviewing a fraction of them to train the models.

Exporting our labor overseas is itself revolutionary. Yeah it sucks for our workers here in the U.S., but it means whole new opportunities overseas for billions of people who can now make some $ tele-operating with no more than an internet connection and a $200 computer.",2024-10-24 05:58:57,1,comment,Section_B
"I agree. 

These tech demo/party events are getting very light on the details and it would have been nice to show an Optimus roadmap slide with current state.

So many people missed the importance of what was presented because they wanted another reason to be angry and Elon gave them one.

I also think the same people would have been equally amazed to know that the robots were being remotely operated for the event as a way to give an early glimpse of what that world will soon be, but only if presented with that information from the very beginning.",2024-10-22 13:16:13,8,comment,Section_B
"I agree. If this is what really Tesla is trying to achieve, then it needs to be said. 

But what did Elon say? The robot can be your friend and do your chores.

Who's coming up with these presentations? A senior VP? There's no way a VP would present that goal. 

Then we circle all the way back again with Elon stans making up extra details, interpretations, and nuances for the CEO.

If the leader can't communicate the goal clearly, then what is he doing?",2024-10-22 13:45:24,7,comment,Section_B
"Not open?  Literally someone asked one of the robots and the person replied with the truth.  It was a product demo, like when other manufacturers make concept cars and show them to the public.  Tesla just happens to actually have their concepts, thus far, match pretty closely to the final result - unlike most other manufacturers.",2024-10-22 13:27:27,4,comment,Section_B
